# Data Analysis with Python â€“ freeCodeCamp

This repository contains my work from the **Data Analysis with Python** course on freeCodeCamp.

Through this course, I learned how to process, analyze, and visualize data using Python libraries like:

- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **SciPy**

## Topics Covered:
- Data cleaning and manipulation
- Statistical analysis
- Data visualization
- Exploratory data analysis
- Working with real-world datasets

## Projects Include:
- Demographic Data Analyzer  
- Sea Level Predictor  
- Medical Data Visualizer  
- Page View Time Series Visualizer

Each project is structured according to the freeCodeCamp guidelines and uses Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis.
